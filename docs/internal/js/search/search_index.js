(\\`.hbs\\` files): Handlebars templates for generating documentation pages\n- **Styles** (\\`.css\\` files): Stylesheets for customizing the appearance\n- **Scripts** (\\`.js\\` files): JavaScript files for additional functionality\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Extract this ZIP file to a directory on your system\n2. Use the \\`--templates\\` flag when running Compodoc to specify the path to your custom templates:\n\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   compodoc -p tsconfig.json --templates ./path/to/custom/templates/\n   \\`\\`\\`\n\n## Template Structure\n\n- \\`page.hbs\\` - Main page template\n- \\`partials/\\` - Directory containing partial templates\n- \\`styles/\\` - Directory containing CSS files\n- \\`js/\\` - Directory containing JavaScript files\n\n## Customization Tips\n\n1. **Templates**: Use Handlebars syntax to customize the HTML structure\n2. **Styles**: Modify CSS to change colors, fonts, layout, etc.\n3. **Scripts**: Add custom JavaScript functionality\n\n## Backup\n\nAlways keep a backup of your original templates before making changes.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more information about customizing Compodoc templates, visit:\nhttps://compodoc.app/guides/template-customization.html\n\nGenerated by Compodoc Template Playground\n`;\n  }\n\n  private downloadBlob(blob: Blob, filename:

Can Do It - Backend API\nThis is a NestJS application using Knex (with PostgreSQL) for the database layer.\nIt includes comprehensive documentation for both the external API (Swagger) and the internal project structure (Compodoc).\n🚀 Features\n\nFramework: NestJS (Modular architecture)\nDatabase: PostgreSQL (via pg driver)\nORM/Query Builder: Knex.js\nAutomatic migration on startup (DbMigrationService)\nGlobal KnexModule for dependency injection\n\n\nDocumentation:\nAPI: Swagger / OpenAPI (auto-generated)\nInternal: Compodoc (static site)\n\n\n\n🛠️ Setup & Installation\n\nInstall Dependencies\nExample :npm install\nDatabase Setup\nThe application defaults to a local Postgres instance:\npostgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres\nTo override this, set the DATABASE_URL environment variable.\n\nRun the Application\nExample :# development\nnpm run start:devThe app will automatically create the users and tasks tables if they don't exist.\n\n\n📚 Documentation\n1. API Documentation (Swagger)\nOnce the app is running, visit:\n👉 http://localhost:3000/api\nTo generate a static HTML file of the API docs:\nExample :# Generates api-docs.html in the root\nnpx redoc-cli bundle swagger.json -o api-docs.html2. Project Documentation (Compodoc)\nTo generate and serve the internal project documentation (Modules, Services, Graphs):\nExample :npm run documentationThen visit: http://localhost:8080\n📂 Project Structure\nExample :src/\n├── common/\n│   └── knex/           # Global Knex module & migration service\n├── controllers/        # API Controllers (Users, Tasks)\n├── models/             # DTOs and Interfaces\n├── services/           # Business Logic\n└── main.ts             # Entry point (Swagger setup)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -

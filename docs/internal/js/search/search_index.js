instance:\npostgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres\nTo override this, set the DATABASE_URL environment variable.\n\nRun the Application\nExample :# development\nnpm run start:devThe app will automatically create the users and tasks tables if they don't exist.\n\n\n📚 Documentation\n1. API Documentation (Swagger)\nOnce the app is running, visit:\n👉 http://localhost:3000/api\nTo generate a static HTML file of the API docs:\nExample :# Generates docs/api-docs.html\nnpm run docs:api2. Project Documentation (Compodoc)\nTo generate and serve the internal project documentation (Modules, Services, Graphs):\nExample :# Generates into docs/internal/ and serves on port 8080\nnpm run docs:internal3.
